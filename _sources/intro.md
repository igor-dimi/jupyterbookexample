# Welcome to your Jupyter Book

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is

It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.

I am adding this text right here.
